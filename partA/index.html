		<h2> About Us (Part 3A)</h2>
		<h3>Goals and Objectives: To provide useful information about several dog breeds.</h3>

<h3>Projected User Community: <h3>
<h3>Age</h3><p>The site provides information regarding food that is good or bad for dogs and breed specific information. It is not expected that the site will receive many visitors in their early 20s or younger. We expect age groups that currently have families or have older children away from home. According to the National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Manufactures Association (APPMA), the average age of the pet owner in the U.S. is almost 43 years old. 
</p>
<h3>Sex</h3>
<p>
Gender will depend largely on the information the visitor wants. If a visitor is looking for food that is bad or good for a dog, it may be more likely that the visitor is a female. This information regards healthy nurturing of a dog, which we anticipate females and older males will be more interested in taking the time to research. 
</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>We expect that most visitors will be educated. Keeping an animal healthy is an expensive ordeal and higher yearly income has been consistently positively correlated with higher education attainment. 

<h3>Tasks and Objectives of Users:</h3>
<p>
To research several breeds’ health, common breed-specific tips, and general information regarding their behavior.<br />
To research healthy and unhealthy foods for dogs.
